# Shifts_Calculator
### This application calculates shift work systems.
#### Once the user enter the reference date and the target date for a sudden vacation during year, the program tell him either this day is in work or holiday and tell him day number of each.
### Mandatory issue :
- The values of ref( Line 12 in code ) MUST be changed to a reference date so that it is the first day of a work shift.
#### i.e
refDay=8, refMon=1, refYear=2020;
